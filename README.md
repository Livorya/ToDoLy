# ToDoLy

Solution for Final Project Web App assignment
A Todo List Web Application

A functioning MVC application that support full CRUD

It is only a prototype with one shared table in the database

OBS! There is a Admin Account with special privileges that is currently hardcoded into the project (admin@todoly.se, a fake email) for anyone interested please take note of this and either create this account or change the account in the ToDoTasksController. The prototype does not support email verification yet

It does not currently support the function of changing the status (marking a task as done) directly in the list on the index page


Thank you for taking interest in my application
